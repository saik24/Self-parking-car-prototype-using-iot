# Self-parking-car-prototype-using-iot
Parking of a 4-wheeler is one of a troublesome and boisterous occupation particularly in a zone where an empty space is obliged as it includes a progression of forward and invert movements and turns which end up being a complicated task for most auto drivers to deal with. Individuals who have quite recently got the hang of driving may likewise observe parking to be an exceptionally troublesome activity. In this project we propose an autonomous self-parking system in a particular parking space. In this system, the vehicle can drive itself and discover the parking spots to automatically park the vehicle utilizing proximity sensors. The system comprises of parking space seeking, vacant space detection and steering control. As indicated by the kind of the parking space (parallel or perpendicular) which has been perceived by the sensors, the system will record the appropriate parking spot and carry out the required parking operation. 

The sensors used in the model are speed sensor(to control the parking speed),ultrasonic sensor (to check the parking spac/empty spaces).

The working prototype is implemented  using ESP32 to connect  with the IOT cloud , which can be used to access the prototype which is remotely controlled via the internet.
